[*Previously, on front.the42.info...*][previously]

The fourth attempt to have some placce to shit post in the traditional "the42way", again due to my lazyness to deal with server and several mental meltdowns, I've had to rebuild, this time in a modern way(which kinda lost the "the42way" tradition).

Own and run by
