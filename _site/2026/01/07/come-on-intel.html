    <h2 id="hi-nvidia">Hi Nvidia!</h2>

<h1 id="fuck-you"><strong>Fuck you.</strong></h1>

<h2 id="so-intel-held-a-keynote-in-ces-with-not-many-things-to-look-at">So Intel held a keynote in CES, with not many things to look at.</h2>

<p>I mean, I am not totally suprised by this…? But I don’t really see much of a exciting news comming out, at least they did have <em>Core Ultra Series 3</em> (gosh please fix your naming Intel).</p>

<p>And they’re only putting Arc B390 onto a SoC, okay…? Ever since Nvidia got involed into this stuff I know they wouldn’t do anything that are consumer friendly like having a lower end dGPU please? Won’t Nvidia might not let them.</p>

<p>Sure, there might be a possibility that Arc B390 will come out as a dGPU later or as a Workstation GPU or sth like that but I am just really disappointed by all this.</p>

<p>And btw, wheres the Arc B770 honey?</p>

<p>Might just stuck with all these B580 paradise, oh speaking of which I’ve been running Gemma 3 12b locally recently, just for fun. Hey it’s fast, but do remember to enable flash attention or the performance really hurt.</p>

<p>And I am not all that into PC building lately since I mainly use my Mac… x86-64 are just for Gaming and High-Performance works and LLMs and LLM translators and some video transcoding and some fun experiments.</p>

<p>Albeit I might rebuild my home “server”, oust the PVE on a ThinkCentre, put a Raspberry Pi CM5 Lite on a extenstion board and put it into a case and call it a day, at least I could put Intel Optane M10 onto it… It’s for voice chatting server only so anyway. Power efficiency is important and I need something that would run on a cheaper UPS.</p>

<p>Alright… see ya, it’s so fucking cold these day.</p>
