It’s this time already?</h2>
<p>For fuck sake I got less than 2-weeks worth of winter break left… one of the reason why I hate having Chinese Lunar New Year this year is the fact that like it hit and then I go to school in Feb.28 which is no fun.<br />
I mean sure it’s because the LNY this year is too late… usually having it by the early Feb or later Jan, nope not this year, and got no winter break extentions for that, like I got a week to enjoy the vide(of sleeping with meal prepping noises) and then I should be at school to do all those shit stuff.<br />
Oh which reminds me before all that I should hit hospital or sth, since I just don’t really break the one-month-one-train-ride biz cauz train fares between some city and another city is too expensive and exhausting… spending 2hrs standing on subway/metro trains and 1hrs on not-all-that-fast Intercity-Express is no fun.<br />
I will be back on late-March for that yellow lil pills but oh well fine. And I am ready to switch from Stilnox/Myslee, gosh I really have enough taking it, last nights sleeps was fine tho, albeit the dreams are still pretty darn weird but hey at least no nightmares that night I guess? But still I am on it for way too long.<br />
Don’t forgot to take that Lithium, otherwise your brain will get you on your knees again, thanks BD.<br />
And remember I should stand firm on my behalf and on my own values and my own interests, my priorities comes first.<br />
Anyway… it gotta be a tough year. I knew it…</p>

<h2 id="addressing-the-whats-next-vide-in-the-room">Addressing the “<em>What’s next?</em>” vide in the room</h2>
<p>Idk… maybe I will work my way out, or maybe dying in the process, I have no idea, and I won’t make any bold statements like “if I killed myself it’s not my intention”(albeit this kms thoughts could be trace all the way back to 2014) becauz I don’t want anyone using this to press me saying that I don’t really want to put an end to this.<br />
I did want to put an end to this, when all the things just got really boring. Like they always like to tell me things like “You shouldn’t knew that much” or “You live painful because you knew too much” but the thing is according to you guys, I only have this chance to live as a human, why not chasing for something greater and even more funny than that is if I choose to listen to yours thoughts about “just live a normal live” I would soon be compared against those better ones.<br />
But nope they still don’t want me to do things that could makes me chase a better life. I am somehow still being jailed by my parents and families.<br />
And oh btw, not being a pure ass fool is a crime now?? how? you guys told me to learn so I learnt.<br />
So I reckon that my “If I can’t do it I will kms” stuff is legit.<br />
Ughh, idk what I was talking about… Idk if there’s any logic innit.</p>

<p>Maybe I will kms only if I wrote a suicide note that’s okay for you to read and is the one that you would be tearful about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mostly on their way of grabbing Master degree in some very well known colleges, you know the drill.</li>

  <li>Really good at things they do.</li>
  <li>100% support from families.</li>
  <li>There parents somehow got a plan long ago but well executed</li>
  <li>Idk why they are still williing to talk to me, I am such a loser anyway.</li>

<p>Comparing with …</p>

<ul>
  <li>Didn’t went to an actual high school. Went to Vocational High instead.</li>
  <li>Struggled in a Vacational College(unless you win big, other wise losers place), and somehow able to struggled out to a better one that could botain BA.</li>
  <li>Struggle to even obtain an Bachelor’s degree after all these years.</li>
  <li>Really bad at things that I needs to do.</li>
  <li>20% Family support only in cash and only when they think you are doing what they think you should, and they tbh don’t know what should do either. and otherwise (most of the time) 0%.</li>
  <li>Parents got a plan, but they don’t know should they with it mid-road or got distracted by sth else or even “you shouldn’t let your kids do that” plus they revealed that I am sort of under the rainbow flag and ceased any plans that could get me to a better place.</li>
  <li>Rotten at home.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR.</h2>
<p>I LOSE. ALREADY, AND I KNEW IT LONG AGO.
I hope things will get slightly better… I know that might not look good but at this point it looks like my only way out.</p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just shut up, I just want to be better, is that a crime?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Yuri Specialist just announced that They got nothing to read in this long day.</title><link href="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/11/the-yuri-expert-got-nothing-to-read-for-a-day.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Yuri Specialist just announced that They got nothing to read in this long day." /><published>2026-02-11T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2026-02-11T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://front.the42.info/2026/02/11/the-yuri-expert-got-nothing-to-read-for-a-day</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/11/the-yuri-expert-got-nothing-to-read-for-a-day.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="uconsole-nvme-upgrade-kit">uConsole NVMe Upgrade Kit</h2>
<p>So I bought <a href="https://hackergadgets.com/products/uconsole-upgrade-kit?variant=47038702682286">this</a>.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uConsole Upgrade Kit - Adding NVMe SSD/RJ45 Ethernet/ USB 3.0/AC1200 WiFi</code><br />
As the title suggest, now I got NVMe SSD and RJ45 GbE and two USB3.0 outta my Raspberry Pi CM5 in that uConsole.<br />
I didn’t expected it to work that well but it did, and because of the fact that I currently don’t have any BIGG NVMe SSD around so I put in a 16GB Optane M10 for swap that I probably never going to use instead.<br />
1-lane PCIe 2.0 sometimes could be up to 3.0? works at nice snappy speed w/o a prob.<br />
The RJ-45 was pulled directly from RP1 southbridge onboard CM5 which is connected to the SoC via 4-lanes of PCIe 2.0, ran great with full-speed GbE(I tested that already).<br />
USB3.0? Haven’t tried that yet but useful later.<br />
At least thats 1 more USB-A onboard the uConsole. And plus a USB-C 3.0 idk could I charge it on that or not yet prob not.<br />
And funny enough it somehow blew my M4 MacBook Air outta the water on some tasks except actual computing that requires a bigger screen and better keyboard and better performance and better battery, uC is enough for my RTL-SDR anyway.(Oh my somehow failed yet on the way Satellite recv project)<br />
Tbh with you I could hardly fill that 4GB RAM on my CM5, I can’t imagine me filling up that M10 in swap, my whole system currently took up 12GB on my SDCard so… But swap on a drive like M10 does somehow extend the life of that SDCard I reckon.<br />
Anyway just enjoying fun on my uConsole.<br />

<h2 id="i-am-out-of-things-to-read">I am out of things to read…</h2>
<p>Right before the Lunar New Year I am already bored. 20hrs after recovered from that depressive period and I rushed to do something else new, I am already out of things to do, or even to read, I was wandering through yamibo for stuff to read while waiting all my favourite novels to update, which is bored, I didn’t sleep well last night, and after waking up at 8am I decided fine I gotta wake up and live a day, turns out to be a pretty boring day, my grandparents and my aunt are making living noises that almost driven me crazy, but that ain’t their fault, just ah fine some part of that was their fault for being too loud, and me being to easy to get disrupt and distract, but whatever.</p>

<p>And remember that I said I gotta watch Haibane Renmei last time? Well after watching two EPs straight during midnight I reckon I don’t have the guts to continue watching it like many other anime I’ve downloaded, might take a while for me to re-enter this, just because like kinda not at the right mood to watch that? I mean not this time, later time(like how I dealt with that anime talks about supposed Introvert Pink Hair Japanese Otaku Girl with her five/six wives anime, someone loves to compares between me and her and I was like bro you gotta be kidding I got my gender wrong for that, and if I was her, I would go and have 10 waifus instead.)</p>

<p>But yep. nothing to do now, maybe rewatch old anime(old means I first watched it a long time ago), notable examples incl. Lucky Star, Serial Experiments Lain, Haruhi Suzumiya 2006, etc…<br />
No HyouKa, since that is a piece of shit that talks about some idiotic high schoolers circlejerking on their circlejerking skills(e.g. how good they “Investigate stuff”).<br />
And no Liz and the Blue Bird since after I got the BD on hand I’ve watched it for like a billion times already, but being a Yuri Specialist <em>My soul</em> is always ready for this kind of top tier Yuri/Lesbian contents.</p>

<h2 id="about-that-qa-i-had-today">About that Q&amp;A I had today</h2>
<p>I really don’t like someone ask me this question:<br />
Q: <em>When can you stop taking those pills?</em><br />
A: Only when doctor say yes.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am a bit tired after dinner, good night, and I should take my pills btw.</p>

<p>Good night, and see you next post.</p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[But at least I got a Optane M10 16GB NVMe drive inside my uConsole up and running.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">It’s no longer funny as joke rn, yet another cycle just dropped.</title><link href="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/10/yet-another-cycle.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="It’s no longer funny as joke rn, yet another cycle just dropped." /><published>2026-02-10T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2026-02-10T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://front.the42.info/2026/02/10/yet-another-cycle</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/10/yet-another-cycle.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="not-much-really-to-say">Not much really to say.</h2>
<p>Just go check last post.</p>

<h2 id="now-i-feel-i-gotta-make-lemon-republic-great-again">Now I feel I gotta make Lemon Republic great again.</h2>
<p>No it’s real.<br />
Meet Lemon Republic’s Yuri Specialist, the one and only the42game is back.<br />
Someone which less than 20hrs was looking for the place to hang themselves.<br />
Now is messing around with <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%99%BE%E5%90%88_(%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%AB)#%E7%94%A8%E8%AA%9E">Yuri Comics and Novels and Anime</a> and actual Japanese Lesbian Drama, omg.<br />
See that’s how fucking crazy Bipolar is, when you enter Manic mode, the globe is on your hand not to mention this person takes <em>Concerta</em> today so even more crazy that they have decided to mess around with their second Intel Arc B580 and found out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel#Modern_situation">Wintel</a> is still true even to this day when the driver/software api supports for Windows is 10x better than that Intel provided for Linux.</p>

<h2 id="will-never-run-llamacpp-with-sycl-on-linux-again">Will never run llama.cpp with SYCL on Linux again.</h2>
<p>Don’t trust me? Run llama.cpp with SYCL on Arch Linux to see for yourself. On Windows it only took 5 mins to set up here I looked for which one is the actual guide to use for Linux that doesn’t shout telemetry to your face yes I am talking about you Ubuntu took me like 2hrs building it took another 1hr, why don’t I just go and buy a Beefy Mac at this point? No offense but I could actually go and buy a 32GB fully loaded M4 Mac mini back home from an Apple Store in less than 1hr no joke.</p>

<p>Be fair the whole setup is poorman’s gaming rig for someone who don’t actually game, R5-3600 factory clock speed with 32GB DDR4 Memory plus Intel Arc B580 in 2026? “Hah!” they laughed in 2025, they stopped laughing in late 2025, and now they’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)">joining(no not that joining in pluribus thats wayyy too crazy for me and I stand with Carol on that, and I just hope ppl won’t download a random executable from whatever alien from space and run it, Vince could see the future)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up?</h2>

<p>So the thing is now I am going to take some pain killlers and some lithiums, and thinking about what I should read next, I might wake up and watch some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haibane_Renmei"><em>Haibane Renmei</em></a>, and maybe do sth else but for now I am going to do sth else, at least I could hangin there for a little bit longer, suicide plan recalled, you won.</p>

<p>So anyway, did ya all see that? Normies? Non-believers? Doctors who really want to look into this(Thank you!)? this is how fucking crazy Bipolar is on my body to a point that even I fricking knew it was happening.  I was about to kill myself last night, and lithiums doesn’t do much, anime did nothing, yuri manga basically nothing, but once switching mode, you got your life on your hand again, just that you are stuck in a loop and you have no idea how painful you would be and the only thing you could do now is to prevent being super hype when in Manic so that when Depressive hits you won’t get yourself killed that fast.</p>

<p>And thank again to those who are still backing me up in this tough spicy situation and standing firmly on my back, and those doctor who actually pays attention to patients feelings.</p>

<p>See ya, gosh I must have watched it some where long time ago… I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haibane_Renmei"><em>Haibane Renmei</em></a>, It feels like something I would watch back when my home still got that large Sony Trinitron CRT with a DVD Player(aka when I was a kid). And I had tons of deja vu moments when watching… idk. Oh yeah the last few part is for my/my docs future reference.<br />
Ughh I am really going to take Lithiums now…</p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not funny anymore fuck I really got bipolar-2.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I should’ve put an end to this long before the outbreak.</title><link href="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/09/live-for-no-reason-is-boring.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I should’ve put an end to this long before the outbreak." /><published>2026-02-09T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2026-02-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://front.the42.info/2026/02/09/live-for-no-reason-is-boring</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/09/live-for-no-reason-is-boring.html"><![CDATA[<p>The whole “Study in Japan” thingy is now pretty much in doomed shape, after which there’s no way for it to progress whatsoever, others(mainly my “relatives” viewed me as “SELFISH” and “NOT CARING ABOUT PARENTS’ FINANCIAL SITUATION” and claimed that I didn’t see the fact that they do a lot of things thinking of me which I largely disagreed, and I would explain that they never went through a proper negociation with me and now we’re here, and they also stands firmly with my parents quote all of them knew when thet let me out and I will never be back, which is true, strikingly true) reckoned that It will be impossible for me in this state to live alone at all.<br />
The last point of which I agree with the most, at my current mental state, it will be impossible for me to achieve anything let alone something that require significant risk, but let me reminds them that the current state of which I am in, were largely caused by my parents, their miscommunication, their unwillingness of proper communication, the unwillingness of properly look at my actual thoughts with a straight eye, and now for anything I further suggests, they either rejected it or just rejected it and push the whole thing onto me to decide which the only thing on the todo list is to recall it.<br />
Which to me, tbh with you is no fun, really no fun, like I don’t know why I am still alive tho?  Why didn’t I kill myself already 10 odd years ago when I’ve decided to jump down the elementry school bldg. for some silly(albeit tbh not so silly) shit.  Why hadn’t I done it 7yrs ago when I got all the shit around me messed up, why I hadn’t done it 5yrs ago when I was at the edge ready to jump?<br />
And I keep on living till now where I am in a outcome that I knew it was coming in the past decade, now I am in it, deadlocked, looped, you know how While True works right, thats where I am in, and sure, I am planning a proper suicide with 100% success rate when executed but the day is on the way and the only question left is how long or how many more chances I want to give to this miserable live I am currently living which I knew that is not bad, I knew, but the truth of I could’ve gone a much much much better way if not for some silliest issues and silliest decicions made by my stubborn parents that thought they knew which is the best for me(which they didn’t) and which plan should they route for me(which they never thought it for more than a second).<br />
I am now in this terrible state where It just never gonna be good, this is the end, just how much longer I am willing to cope with this bullshit, and every couple of days I went into a loop where I believed things could got better or things is done time to go type of loop, endless.<br />
And I really must’ve said that I was furious when I heard of that my mom probably didn’t really care when I was getting into troubles, and now everyone believe its all my faults, and I was really furious about the fact that no one, absolutely no one, paid any attentions to me till I finally did something others never done before, even in my own fucking family, and they attack me for it, they create terrible stereotype for me based on that, e.g. the only reason I use a computer is when I game, like who the fuck you guys think you are, and who the fuck you guys really met with me during the year anyway, how many you guys know about me anyway, credit to my uncle(this time my mom’s younger bro) and his son(for now), that actually sat down, listen to me and my thoughts and let me actually explain what I am using (a clockworkpi uConsole), any explain why they’re interesting on it and what types of connections caused them to ask me about it(turns out his son in his 12, knew what Debian is and how to use a computer and I was like heck yeah you should go and continue down the road) which I am thankful of.<br />
Some might be asking, did your mom change for the slightest after all those shoutouts? I might say yes, but not for now, like I don’t really think she will change, and she was probably just going to escape from all of this and like nothing will change like the good old times.<br />
But anyway the only thing I wanted to say is that, a decision has been made, I will probably give two more quarters worth of chance to myself, and I would have myself kill, in my own hands, out of my own will, in a quiet day that nobody is going to know about place, to end all this.<br />
Which 2004.04.24 -&gt; Sometime in late-Q1/early-Q2 2026.<br />
I hope I could become a ghost that no one could notice and spying on anyone that have a good life for my own pleasure and I like to watch.</p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty much entered a fully block-out dead end and I don't want that.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">It caught me off guard again, this time with a far worst timing.</title><link href="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/08/bipolar-caught-me-off-guard.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="It caught me off guard again, this time with a far worst timing." /><published>2026-02-08T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2026-02-08T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://front.the42.info/2026/02/08/bipolar-caught-me-off-guard</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://front.the42.info/2026/02/08/bipolar-caught-me-off-guard.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="howdy-somehow-back">Howdy, somehow back.</h1>
<p>I am kinda back after at least 4 days worth of extreme depressive period, with every single day more suffering than the days before it.<br />
You woked up late everyday even after full 12hrs of sleep that even me being someone who loves to sleep(i guess) starts to dislike this fact, when you’re asleep, all the nightmares are chasing you on your ass, 12hrs(maybe 8hr dreaming) worth of shit show chasing you on your back sure wasn’t something you would love to do.<br />
But you simply can’t get rid of it, your body simply drag you back down continue sleeping for no reason, I guess it’s not just about pills this time.<br />
My mom caught the worst timing in all of this yet, she tried to see how I am doing right in the middle of a transitional period(which my brain is on it’s way to tranform itself into depressive mode from a mixed/manic mode which I did a lot a thing for fun.)<br />
I simply just shit out a tons of fact that I simply didn’t enjoy all those playing card moment she gave me and all those single option choices she gave me and the fact that she never really stood up for me when I am the most in need.<br />
I mean, I did put all that down a few years ago and I am simply telling her the fact, and which somehow broke her and I am sorry about that but I don’t have time for that as well since I am starting to tearing all apart as well.<br />
And oh btw, the whole thing about “How happy you was in the Manic Period, how suffer you will be in the Depressive Period” is true I guess, I am now taking Lithiums and stuff like that regulary according to the prescription and after I told my doc about this she said we really needs to get that manic heat a bit down other wise I might get myself killed if Depressive hit.  Which I almost did yesterday.  I’ve already chosen a method for that.</p>
<h1 id="so-where-was-i-again-before-all-this">So… Where was I again, before all this</h1>
<p>I was messing with my GK-2A recepetion setup, and my receipt printer right before all those hit, and Idk maybe some other shit I forgot about.<br />
I did manage to set it up, but some how the long distance won’t do the trick, I guess I will move it back to the old house I reckon, after Lunar New Year I think.<br />
And my receipt printer stuff is running fine for now, printing news every 6 hrs for me to read. Yes I actually read news.</p>
<h1 id="next">Next?</h1>
<p>Idk I forgot/don’t want to take Concerta today so I am a bit hairy now and needs to sort things out, maybe I will just have some simple stuff sort out like replacing the screen protectors and dealing with miniDLAN/UPnP media server and watch some more YouTube and more Mangas for sure.<br />
And my somehow broken uConsole case’s 3D-printed replacement is going to arrive sometime tonight, and I guess that right-wing populist will win that snap election, ofc I hope she won’t but according to the numbers its… most likly the case.</p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[And I am drafting my own "My Final Anwser to Life".]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I made something to monitor my Raspberry Pi 3 at home.</title><link href="https://front.the42.info/2026/01/27/simp-rpi-ups-mon.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I made something to monitor my Raspberry Pi 3 at home." /><published>2026-01-27T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2026-01-27T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://front.the42.info/2026/01/27/simp-rpi-ups-mon</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://front.the42.info/2026/01/27/simp-rpi-ups-mon.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="context">Context</h1>
<p>So I had this little Raspberry Pi 3 sitting around which I bought back in 2016.<br />
Yes I am still using it, why not?<br />
So recently I decided to let it run something instead of biting dust at home I installed DietPi on it and use it as a real server for some thing that I would actually use everyday, being slow is okay too, it’s fun innit?<br />
Anyway, in order to see how bad CSG is doing here I’ve decided to attach a <a href="https://github.com/linshuqin329/UPS-18650">mini UPS</a> to it, which pretty much is a block that sits underneath your Pi with two 18650 batteries connected to a <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX17040-MAX17041.pdf">MAX17041</a>.<br />
And what it brings is some I2C connection to my Pi for some stats to read, and with that plus A HUGE MERGER OF MY OTHER THREE PREVIOUS PROJECTS with something more blended in it, I’ve created:<br />
<a href="https://gist.github.com/theskanthunt42/02de49d7190eb4a0a867d66c2e532e10">SimpUPSMon</a> - <em>Some readings from my Raspberry Pi and it’s “UPS”</em>(sic)<br />
Which read some status from the Pi, some status from your browser, and <em>bang</em>！<br />
Oh and I hand wrote a basic HTTP server for this, just becauz I am lazy… so I just grab socket and do some rough TCP send thing… and called it a server.</p>

<p>No Place is My Home really.</p>

<p>But whatever, I will just stop here, it’s not like any of you could really understand or relate to any of this anyway, you all frickin’ assholes.</p>

<p>Yeah, I am weak, not good enough, and I don’t have the dedications to work my way up in this situation.<br />
I am lazy yeah sure.</p>

<p>It’s like… I don’t know if you guys are doing it on purpose, or just you are terribly bad at <em>“空気読め”</em><br />
But can you guys just STOP MENTIONING HOW BAD YOU LIVE OR HOW TERRIBLE A DECISION YOU’VE MADE when it’s OBIVIOUS THAT NO MATTER HOW “BAD” YOU LIVE, YOU STILL GOT A FAR FUCKING SUPERIOR LIFE THAN ME.</p>

<p>Just stop it and get some rest, really.<br />
Like, your mis-step or failure is like you messed up a single note so you didn’t win that whatever fucking international piano contests’(which your parent had it all arrange for you, and there wasn’t really much effort you need, just 2 years worth of afternoon class with a private teacher every Friday after you done with your private fucking school or sth) first prize and you can’t go to sleep all night when you was like 7yo.<br />
Or your pain is you didn’t get that praise from some specific teacher back in your “painful-youth” at an  international school or whatever.</p>

<p>I simply, don’t gives a fucking shit about it, nor is it some shit I could really fucking relates to, FULL FUCKING STOP.</p>

<p>Let’s make it clear, I am not poor or rich, simply a fucking college student in a middle-lower income working class family, and this is my limit, alright? Ofc, I knew there’s some improvements that COULD’VE BEEN MADE BACK IN THOSE DAYS BUT THATS HOW THIS WORLD WORKS!<br />
I went to public schools, most of my life(sometimes I went to private schools that it’s only purpose is to rip my wallet off but is the only way I could get a Bachelor degree), I don’t have rich fucking parents to help me with my shit, I learnt all this crap on my fucking own, in my fucking own free time, 50/50 on my fucking own free will/or being forced to. In order to talk to you bunch of fucking motherfucking mosquitoes that only knows how to suck on others suffering in a fucking greenhouse.</p>

<p>Just fucking stop, and don’t pretend you could relate with lower class(than you)’s miserable life.<br />
It’s GROSS!</p>

<p><strong>FUCK YOU.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could you guys just shut up?

  <p>Yes, that Finder™ by Apple 1983-2026, kinda cool innit?
It’s the remake of “desktop” by the same author which came out in 2004: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD4Mz-pY9oA</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It’s been a busy(and sleepy) week so I don’t have that many time circle through my Apple Music playlist.<br />
I just repeat all those tracks I’ve recommended in the last <em>“issuse”</em> of MotW, but there are some stand-outs still.</p>

<p>Wait what had I done this week, oh I’ve watched Pluribus on Apple TV, great show by the amazing Vince Gilligan crew again!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Okay not much to say really… just stay tune for more… I’ve been asleep most of the time since went back home.</p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Music I looped on Wk 3 2026]]></summary></entry></feed>
