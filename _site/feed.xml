<p>So I had this little Raspberry Pi 3 sitting around which I bought back in 2016.<br />
Yes I am still using it, why not?<br />
So recently I decided to let it run something instead of biting dust at home I installed DietPi on it and use it as a real server for some thing that I would actually use everyday, being slow is okay too, it’s fun innit?<br />
Anyway, in order to see how bad CSG is doing here I’ve decided to attach a <a href="https://github.com/linshuqin329/UPS-18650">mini UPS</a> to it, which pretty much is a block that sits underneath your Pi with two 18650 batteries connected to a <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX17040-MAX17041.pdf">MAX17041</a>.<br />
And what it brings is some I2C connection to my Pi for some stats to read, and with that plus A HUGE MERGER OF MY OTHER THREE PREVIOUS PROJECTS with something more blended in it, I’ve created:<br />
<a href="https://gist.github.com/theskanthunt42/02de49d7190eb4a0a867d66c2e532e10">SimpUPSMon</a> - <em>Some readings from my Raspberry Pi and it’s “UPS”</em>(sic)<br />
Which read some status from the Pi, some status from your browser, and <em>bang</em>！<br />
Oh and I hand wrote a basic HTTP server for this, just becauz I am lazy…</p>

<p>It’s like… I don’t know if you guys are doing it on purpose, or just you are terribly bad at <em>“空気読め”</em><br />
But can you guys just STOP MENTIONING HOW BAD YOU LIVE OR HOW TERRIBLE A DECISION YOU’VE MADE when it’s OBIVIOUS THAT NO MATTER HOW “BAD” YOU LIVE, YOU STILL GOT A FAR FUCKING SUPERIOR LIFE THAN ME.</p>

<p>Just stop it and get some rest, really.<br />
Like, your mis-step or failure is like you messed up a single note so you didn’t win that whatever fucking international piano contests’(which your parent had it all arrange for you, and there wasn’t really much effort you need, just 2 years worth of afternoon class with a private teacher every Friday after you done with your private fucking school or sth) first prize and you can’t go to sleep all night when you was like 7yo.<br />
Or your pain is you didn’t get that praise from some specific teacher back in your “painful-youth” at an  international school or whatever.</p>

<p>I simply, don’t gives a fucking shit about it, nor is it some shit I could really fucking relates to, FULL FUCKING STOP.</p>

<p>Let’s make it clear, I am not poor or rich, simply a fucking college student in a middle-lower income working class family, and this is my limit, alright? Ofc, I knew there’s some improvements that COULD’VE BEEN MADE BACK IN THOSE DAYS BUT THATS HOW THIS WORLD WORKS!<br />
I went to public schools, most of my life(sometimes I went to private schools that it’s only purpose is to rip my wallet off but is the only way I could get a Bachelor degree), I don’t have rich fucking parents to help me with my shit, I learnt all this crap on my fucking own, in my fucking own free time, 50/50 on my fucking own free will/or being forced to. In order to talk to you bunch of fucking motherfucking mosquitoes that only knows how to suck on others suffering in a fucking greenhouse.</p>

<p>Just fucking stop, and don’t pretend you could relate with lower class(than you)’s miserable life.<br />
It’s GROSS!</p>

<p><strong>FUCK YOU.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could you guys just shut up?

<p>I ain’t smart enough to not be an normie, I’ve already fully recognized it.<br />
Albeit I hate to be an normie.<br />
But I simply can’t.<br />
I don’t have the money, the ability to earn the money, and all the relationships to help me start to get some money or help to not be a normie.<br />
I am done.<br />
I mean, my life now is pretty much not worth living and I would want to end it.<br />
I hate all those rich bastard whom grew up and lived in a greenhouse and still failed to acknowledge that and claim their own “unfortunate” to others who grew up with a much worse situation.<br />
My problems were simple, my family tends to do bad choices at a bad time, simply out of silly believes and only hope things to be in their control, but not actually choose it because it’s beneficiary to the actual problem.<br />
And my own problem is that I am a coward. Afraid to speak up after all those shit…<br />
My family didn’t help me when I was being bullied, instead they sided with the bullies, and pointing fingers at me, and only after so many years the only <em>“apology”</em> I’ve got was “Oh I am sorry for that.” and nothing else.<br />
Meanwhile on the internet, the only place I thought I could rely and hide, now is turning it’s back on me.<br />
Rich assholes all around, they simply can’t even understand some basic shit going on in the society, are they totally a bad person? Probably not. But because of those misunderstanding they tends to be the bully.<br />
They just got better family, better parents who actually wants to help, and better financial background, and even for those “not all that rich” they got families that actually care. But not me.<br />
After all this, I always asked myself, do I still believe in the whole: “Hey I want to do something interesting or I live my own life.” project? With all this? I guess I haven’t totally give up on it yet, but mostly there.<br />
And let’s say this, uh… I’ve decided in my late 10s that I would just go Kill MySelf when I fully acknowledge that I can do nothing to achieve any of that.<br />
And on that behalf, let’s talk about something you guys hate or afraid to talks about, those mental health pills, actually really extend my life for some years, I could’ve already killed myself years ago. I reached sort of a mostly stable state instead of looking at the road crossing with car running through it everyday and think should I jump or cry in my futons everyday. No I actually starts to achieve something.  Really just stop asking me to stop taking pills, I tried, but nope that just how broken my brain is, and oh you might say “You wasn’t like that before you took those pills.”, bullshit, like what you have a cancer and you could no longer bear with it and you go through the therapy and take pills and take more care of yourself is a crime now? Like I was on the edge, did you guys helped me back then anyway? Anyone notice? Anyone please? Tons of garbage.<br />
So anyway, yeah sure when I see no chance in live the lifes I want to live in I would just end it, it’s been too much of a painful journey by this point.<br />
Just too many trauma and I am simply broken at this point, I just wants to be here for a bit longer.<br />
Yes, it’s painful to live, but for someone who actually been kicked out from hospital when seeking for help in physical issues by doctors and got shout at, and many simillar experiences as well, I just really hate to trust anyone anymore.<br />
I just love to mask myself, like it’s not even within my control. And I love to stay alone in order to back to normal again.</p>

<p>Alright I’ve talked too much, no one is gonna to read other than me anyway.<br />
Sometime just wondering will some of you attend my funeral or something lol, what would you think when I die, will you be unhappy or you just simply don’t care lol<br />
Just have my remainings (rust) somewhere in Japan’s ocean or lake or sth, that’s a beautiful place.<br />
But no worry, It won’t be now, I just want to stick a bit longer, and choosing a method to die that did not hurt that much or looks good is hard. And no one will care anyway.
I hate when ppl pretending they actually cared about others death.<br />
Why was I being born in the first place?<br />
My other shell just mask me inside it too well.</p>

<p>It’s not like I want to be proud of it or sth, oh btw, like, a lot of the weird ppl like to talk about their weirdness but they are all successful dudes and I am not so I won’t.<br />
Let’s all make it clear:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is painful to live for being weird.<br />
You’re weird? Won’t have much friends, even you have any. And you will be prone to Ijime or Bullying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like at least for me I masked and learnt how to masked myself really hard, in order to keep me safe and won’t be hated by others.  Heck, my mom and some at her age used to say things like “You are really good at getting along with people!” or “Wow <strong>[MISGENDER MESS]</strong> really knows how to keep up with the others in an new enviornment! Amazing!”.<br />
Hey guys… it’s hard… and it’s painful in the process, and I have to act like I am normal all the time and with all those weird thing in my mind, which I have to always look at how others did it cautiously and tring to understand why they have to think like that, it’s so damn fucking hard. And in the end of course I wouldn’t understand them at all or sth, and sometimes if I walked too closely with others they will just got angry with me and be like “Why the fuck you can’t understand all this, do something!”(but do what really? What should I do when others angry with me, ACK my fault and apologize? I did but they didn’t accept it at all). And the end results was like either they forgive about me on this and understand I can’t do things like a normal one or I just walked away with no more connections with them(ofc most of the time they will be back after a few years or months but… I am sorry…)<br />
You know I used to thought “Hey I know I am a bit weird but others are the same they just masked it perfectly or sth” but turns out thats not the truth anyway.<br />
Speaking of which, I can’t really understand most of your feelings like… I can’t even discribe it but just so weird you guys, like why the fuck a lot of you just suddenly wants to date with a random (I don’t really know if that’s beauty or not) classmates that you just know about, for a bit, and you guys don’t really talk much anyway, why? That’s straight out lewd and disgustings but from my experience as a <strong>[OMG I HATE THIS GENDER THING]</strong> thats the norm…?  And I am the one thats being weird???</p>

<p>Besides, there are also alot of things I can’t understand, like I only use English medium to gather most of the informations like news or sometimes in Japanese, and I wrote my blogs in English, and I just watch a tons of videos on YouTube thats also in English, but it seems like that it’s a tall order for most of other guys…? at least for those around me.<br />
Like they love to talk about huge effort into learning or acquiring English as a second language, and from what I can tell yes they did, and they really seems desperate on topics like this. But when I said, hey you could try my way, watch, listen and use everyday, and just read read read and read, soon you will have a huge improvements, I did that for more than 10 years now and I don’t really go to some places thats speaks English.  But they were all like “yeah sure, but I simply can’t understand what they’re talking about.”  And oh my god I told them that “I don’t understand at first as well, but I just somehow learn it in this way and I just slowly started to understand what they were talking about like a baby growing up learning languages, and those Vids I picked are sth I am interested in anyway.”<br />
They said okay and went back and after that they still complains about they can’t understand English and oh boy what I saw just someone greedily doomscrolling on their phone with those fucking boring and “made to be funny but not actually funny” shit shorts.  And at that moment I realized that they’re doommed…</p>

<p>Speaking of Shorts(or <em>“TikToks”</em>), I don’t love those things… everysingle time when I accidentally got trolled into a YouTube shorts or something that was only posted on shorts I just have my brain immediately spills DANGER all over and just tell me to be aware, don’t scroll.  And I think I don’t really prefer those short vids… no context, not all that effort really, and not worth my time… and there are endless shorts waiting for you.<br />
But on the other hand, I love scrolling Twitter…? But most of my feeds are illustrations or interesting Japanese posts, albeit my “love” really depends if I am in the mood or not.  Oh and theres the YouTube thing… Yeah I love documentary on tech or some demostration vids(so I don’t need to buy them). And I love to rewatch all the things I’ve watch before and wait for bots to find something I might like for me.</p>

<p>Alright anyway, Idk, I am a bit bored just so I have a lot of things to say, and my social battery went out of batts this week so I don’t feel like go to SNS and have a deep chat with friends or sth, I needs to be alone, to be happy or like to talk with others again.  If some of you actually read this far down here, I apologize for all those “Not online in 10hrs moment…” I just simply don’t want to, my brain is trying to stop me from doing it, I an tired. I am sorry…</p>

<p>And there’s the other thing I felt I am pretty weird in, when I was still a… uuh… normal students that not yet needed to take mental health pills, I used to admire those who does, like they had the freedom to take it, normal pals will be afraid of them since they don’t want to accidentally hurt them for whatever reason(to those normal pals, thank you, but all of you are cowards afraid of deaths).  But now after I’ve got most part of my brain messed up and take tons a pill a day to keep on track with my life I started thinking: This shouldn’t be like this, albeit again, it does feel a bit more free, my parents are more careful towards my feelings and my thoughts, they will no longer force me or surveillance me 24*7(I will talk about more on this later, but one question for you: have you ever been required by your parents to let them check the status of your pee or the status of your shit after you take a dump in toliet? Go figure. Tho I don’t really hate them that much now, I reckon they just did it like thet’re crazy…) but is that it…? With the cost of they still not really want me to study abroad or even allowing me to live on my own… Really? Yeah gotta admit I have regrets on that, but my mental health at that point could no longer suffer so…</p>

<p>Ah, and there’s good old Shenzhen Museme debacle, I won’t talk about it as well, although I am in pretty stable mental states now but won’t ever try. I no longer have nightmares related to it in recent years (at least after 2023 when I realized hey I was just in the wrong place with a bunch of assholes, oh fuck I should stop talking about this, I started to remember what happened… FULL STOP).</p>

<p>So hey, how’s your first full week in 2026 been? whoa time flies so fast, tho I some how feeling 2025 felt like an eternal but also not… weird…</p>

<p>I still needs to figure out something in the next few days:</p>
<ul>
  <li>iPod Touch or Nokia Touchscreens
    <ul>
      <li>if iPod touch that really ain’t all that much fun, but hey at least it got iOS 15… wait that’s a bit too old as well.</li>
      <li>if Nokia, Symbian or MeeGo/Maemo?
        <ul>
          <li>if Symbian, N8 or 808 Pureview?(I prefer the latter tbh, but N8 was my dream machine when I was a kid!)</li>
          <li>if MeeGo/Maemo, N9 or N900…? both seems fun</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Only reason that I ain’t buying yet: all of them HSDPA at best… and 3G was pretty much long gone here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Should I gave it a chance and study that subject I have no idea on for the finals? Or just praise for the best, like I did when dealing with French, wait no I actuallt spent some time on it.</li>
  <li>The whole Concerta situation… should I take it tmr(weekends) to write more shit or read more stuff online in front of my PC or just not take anything and go grab some sleep for a boring whole day?</li>
</ul>

<p>Too messed up, I am way too messed up… But whatever…<br />
I reckon I should figure out how to install old OSX on my modern VM lol.<br />
Anyway, see ya next post.</p>

<p>Oh wait, heres some music I really enjoyed today(again, by namitape):</p>

<p>本文主要打算探讨笔者在校园里所观察到的一些东西，之所以暂时用中文写的原因是我打算在无歧义的情况下先归纳总结再重新用中文写一篇，外加有些行为或许用中文语境描述会较为方便，别担心，会有英语正本的，只不过我真的被考试周折腾得半死（主要是考试无论如何也在消耗脑力而太累）<br />
说起来，我觉得大学真的是一个非常好的观察人间百态的地方，我希望我以后可以专门观察人类，我喜欢观察（我感兴趣的）</p>

<h2 id="我要探讨什么在此之前先上案例">我要探讨什么，在此之前，先上案例</h2>

<p>是这样，我似乎之前在某篇blog或者Channel Post中所提及过有关于我在学校（大概夏天的时候，经常下雨的日子）所见到的一个奇怪的现象<br />
我知道你们会把这个现象称作“从众心理” et cetera. 之类的不管了 但是我自己去Wikipedia之类的看这个的定义似乎又不是特别符合，更像是“群体迷思”或者是“群体认知错误”<br />
这件事情是这样的，先来个背景：</p>

<ul>
  <li>那天之前的前几天偶尔会下雨，当天天气也很阴沉（与前几天一样）</li>
  <li>地上还有些之前留下的积水</li>
  <li>基于上述原因那天基本上学生都带伞了，包括我在内</li>
  <li>但是那天 <strong>并 没 有</strong> 下雨</li>
  <li>我接下来要描述的事情发生在下午第一节课下课的时候，位置于学院之门口</li>
  <li>我那时也正在离开学院，但是突然注意到门口挤着大量的人因此很纳闷，故开始观察别人</li>
</ul>

<p>我看着天空也并没有在下雨，连树叶都没在动，风都没有，但是奇妙的事情发生了：<br />
有几位学生走出去，看了看天空，然后站在门口开始打伞<br />
后面的人见状，也开始停下拿出雨伞<br />
于是所有人就挤在那里，一个又一个的先看前面打伞的人，再看了下天空，然后对同僚说：“喂喂下雨了快打伞”</p>

<p>literally所有人就挤在那里然后重复上述的行为，等到我终于挤出去的时候街上几乎所有人都打伞了（除了几个看起来没带伞或者也觉得纳闷的人）<br />
从那里出去但是又没打伞我：😐 Okie…<br />
我在外面走着，眼镜上是连一丁点水滴都没见到，掏出手机继续走，屏幕上也是一滴水也见不到，何苦？</p>

<h2 id="我的思考如下">我的思考，如下</h2>

<p>很小的时候经常被教训“人是群体动物”，现在看也确实，但是其实那句话说的不是“人类能存活是靠群体分工合作”而是在说”不要当少数派”<br />
我倒是觉得他们基本上都是出于“别人都在打伞，那绝对就是在下雨”的想法，而不是主观上的要“跟从”，而是一种盲从，而盲从这个词是我觉得最好的可以用来形容大学生的一个词语，很多事情也可以观察到这个现象，诸如：</p>
<ul>
  <li>其实并没有去图书馆学习的必要，但是基于同学或者舍友都在图书馆复习，而开始担忧自己复习成效，反而一同前去图书馆最后落得<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">Doomscrolling</a>的下场</li>
  <li>购入大量Trending的Item，并非出于需要，而是出于作为社交货币或者谈资的用途，以及<em>大家都在买</em></li>
  <li><strong>“情绪价值”</strong></li>
  <li>你知道吗其实那个玩意真的丑爆了，谁设计的，塑料垃圾，网红经济就是个骗局（其实和上一个一样，只不过多了很多付费宣传员）</li>
  <li>我自己的例子：填写平时成绩的时候等待别人先填写完再折中减少一些，或者直接写一样的来利用<em>法不责众</em>的效益（这也是一种从众不对嘛）</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>

<p>没事我写的这篇东西肯定会被指责“其实大家都知道你别必要有优越感的说出来”，“不要太把自己当回事”等等<br />
我知道你们的内心现在就是这样想的，因为我从小到大就被这样说啊，不过不重要，我也有我的反驳：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“你这就是典型的从众思维，再说了那也比你们知道而不说最后在这急眼稍有价值一些。”</em></p>

<h2 id="okie-but-i-am-pretty-tired-and-not-motivated">Okie but i am pretty tired and not motivated.</h2>

<p>In this post I would trying to explain and comment or figuring out why on stuff I’ve notice around the school (or campus, or college, tho I reckon this is not a real college lmao), I wrote the Chinese version first since I’ve just coped through a tough ass French exam that I regret the most on choosing, why the hell I could only choose Espanol and <em>Francais</em>, fuck sake wheres Japanese…?<br />
Exams are so tiring no matter what.</p>

<p>Alright back to topic, so this is the English copy I promised, which is not directly translated using translator like most others do but a complete rewrite, and not a 1:1 one.</p>

<p>Famous quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think college campuses are a great place to observe humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(That’s if you could avoid losing your humanity in the process)</p>

<h2 id="case-first-then-case-studies">Case first, then <em>case studies</em></h2>

<p>I used to mentioned on my Telegram Channel (I guess) about something I observed in a <em>cloudy</em> summer day.</p>

<p>I know you guys will just call it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity">Conformity</a> <em>et cetera[sic]</em> or whatever, but when I check online about it it’s more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance">Collective delusion</a> when (at least in my POV, I am no expert on this) many people happen to in a single place and they are mostly alone not in a group with their friends or sth in that place and suddenly someone in this many people decides to do or believe on something wrong or stupid and others just follow suit without their own judgement.</p>

<p>So tldr:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It have been raining for a few days, and that day was quite cloudy. (just like days before it)</li>
  <li>Some waterponds formed due to reason above.</li>
  <li>And because of the cloudy weather most of the students were taking umbrella with them, incl. me.</li>
  <li>But it never rained that day.</li>
  <li>It happened when the first class in the afternoon just end and most were leaving the college building via the front entrance.</li>
  <li>I was leaving too but the entrance were so crowdy and I am quite confused with it, so I started to observing others.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the first thing I did when I saw some are opening the umbrella is looking at the sky but found out it wasn’t raining at all, not even windy(You could tell by leaves weren’t moving at all, either by rain drops or by wind), but:</p>

<p>Someone walked out of the building, and stopped to looking at the skies, and are opening their umbrellas.<br />
Others noticing this did the same as well.</p>

<p>And the end result was most of them just stopped and did the same and now theres a little traffic jam going on.<br />
And btw I heard someone talking to their pals said: “Hey it’s raining just put on your umbrella!”<br />
When I finally got out of there I realised that most of the ppl on streets were using umbrellas(other than few pals forgot to bring one, and theres me).<br />
Me walking outta there without holding umbrella be like: 😐 Okie…<br />
And I walked back to dorm without seeing a single drop of water on my glasses, wtf.</p>

<h2 id="real-tldr">REAL TL;DR</h2>

<p>I know in this case, Conformity played an important role, since when the amount of ppl around you are large enough, humanity tends to form a idea on others thinking “why this guy is weird not like us” and get pressurized to do the same albeit they know this is wrong or not needed.<br />
And I reckon that they’re not “I should following everything others did” but more like “From others action it seems like that it is raining outside” and they could chose not to do the thing others did according to this condition.<br />
I remembered that when I was a child(yes to some I am still are) I am always being told or <em>scold</em> with “Humans are social animals living in group.”(<em>“人类是群体动物”</em>), true, but what they actually meant was “Don’t be a weirdo.” instead of “We all do our own different part in human society.”<br />
Oh speaking of which, I always think of “blind obedience” an important symbol of (esp. mainland Chinese) college students or those in the similar age, which that’s exactly what someones(incl. multiple group of ppl) want anyway, and some more examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No need to actually go and study in library but still went to due to their class/dormmates were all doing it(which mostly based on the same reason), and starting to panic/doubt if they’re actually okay to go on and have the final exams. But ended up <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">Doomscrolling</a></em> all day in library without doing much(which might cause more anxiety).</li>
  <li>Buying tons of those “Trendy” item online without the actuall need, purely out of using it as something to talk about with others, and/or just because everyone had one.</li>
  <li><strong>“Emotional Value”</strong></li>
  <li>You know what? Those figurines sold in Pop Mart are ugly as fk, who the hell designed it? Total plastic waste, all those “trendy item” are just yet another way to scam(which just like the one I metioned before, albeit with tons more paid advertisers claiming or not claiming ther’re paid to praise).</li>
  <li>Things I did: I just simply wait for others to submit their class performance score to figure out how much of a score I should fill in order to be “the average” for my own good. (I know.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>

<p>I know after I wrote about all this there are surely some idiots pointing fingers at me and shout “We all knew it haha, you’re such an idiot for saying it out loud like nobody knew it lmao” or “Who the fuck you think you are?” etc.<br />
I know, that’s what most of you guys are thinking right now, since I always get scold like this ever since my childhood, but it’s fine, all I want to say is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>At least I talked about it out loud unlike you guys, what you said just classic Conformity.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking of which, why the filename/hyperlink of this post (both in English or in Chinese) were related to the word “motivated”:</p>

<p>^ Which sums up my Exam Week perfectly: “Whatever.”, not motivated anyway (With the added confidence boosted by the fact that I am in “English major” but brought an IELTS 8.0 with me, and now I don’t worry about anything lol, most of them at least, other than stuff like French, Omg I hate French the language, not the French…)<br />
I am so tired anyway… See ya.<br />

<h1 id="fuck-you"><strong>Fuck you.</strong></h1>

<h2 id="so-intel-held-a-keynote-in-ces-with-not-many-things-to-look-at">So Intel held a keynote in CES, with not many things to look at.</h2>

<p>I mean, I am not totally suprised by this…? But I don’t really see much of a exciting news comming out, at least they did have <em>Core Ultra Series 3</em> (gosh please fix your naming Intel).</p>

<p>And they’re only putting Arc B390 onto a SoC, okay…? Ever since Nvidia got involed into this stuff I know they wouldn’t do anything that are consumer friendly like having a lower end dGPU please? Won’t Nvidia might not let them.</p>

<p>Sure, there might be a possibility that Arc B390 will come out as a dGPU later or as a Workstation GPU or sth like that but I am just really disappointed by all this.</p>

<p>And btw, wheres the Arc B770 honey?</p>

<p>Might just stuck with all these B580 paradise, oh speaking of which I’ve been running Gemma 3 12b locally recently, just for fun. Hey it’s fast, but do remember to enable flash attention or the performance really hurt.</p>

<p>And I am not all that into PC building lately since I mainly use my Mac… x86-64 are just for Gaming and High-Performance works and LLMs and LLM translators and some video transcoding and some fun experiments.</p>

<p>Albeit I might rebuild my home “server”, oust the PVE on a ThinkCentre, put a Raspberry Pi CM5 Lite on a extenstion board and put it into a case and call it a day, at least I could put Intel Optane M10 onto it… It’s for voice chatting server only so anyway. Power efficiency is important and I need something that would run on a cheaper UPS.</p>

<p>Alright… see ya, it’s so fucking cold these day.</p>]]></content><author><name>the42game</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="intel" /><category term="computers" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I told you so.]]></summary></entry></feed>
