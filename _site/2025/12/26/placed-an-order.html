    <h2 id="previously-on-the42front"><a href="/2025/12/26/i-hate-school.html">Previously… on the42Front…</a></h2>

<p>So I ended up made a deal with my friend Yuri to purchase their Intel Arc B580, their B580 is going to be replace by an RTX 5070. So whoa, huge shout outs to them again, thanks! Since I prefer buying things from someone I trust than some random second hand seller online.</p>

<p>And also this morning: I bought an Apple Watch S11 42mm on Apple Store, which I will go and pick up tomorrow. Yay!!! My 1st Gen SE could finally retire.</p>

<p><strong>NEVER BUY THE SE, JUST PAY MORE FOR MUCH BETTER LONGER LASTING WATCH!</strong></p>

<p>And some of the things seems to have been largely resolved, thank god, at least I hope so… my intelligence collected from my spider sense is true… Hope this will fade in time.</p>

<h1 id="the-qa-session-begins-here">The Q&amp;A Session begins here.</h1>

<h2 id="q-what-about-your-planned-trip-to-japan">Q: What about your planned trip to Japan?</h2>

<p>A: Well… something happened and something that’s out of my control also happened, and quite a tall order for me to go as planned.</p>

<p>So I rescheduled it to mid-2026, prob. on my own that time, Hokkaido centered. And Tokyo.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-about-your-jlpt-n2-by-mid-2026-plan">Q: What about your JLPT N2 by mid-2026 plan?</h2>

<p>A: That remains intact as I am still working hard on reading Japanese stuff, now I prefer to read stuff in Japanese on sites like Wikipedia.</p>

<p>And now I conclues that 95% of the goal set on developing NCRL MuLang SX-J/Input (which includes Reading and Listening functions) was reached.</p>

<p>For writing and grammar and speaking… well, that need some time.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-would-you-conclude-this-term">Q: How would you conclude this term?</h2>

<p>A: Well… Menhera coated with slim piece of Wax on the <em>C0ncerta</em> and tons of other pills… and almost got me killed. Combating with Adversaries all around the clock. But hey I’ve won most of the battle anyway, much superior you see? Beated the shit outta’em! with least efforts!</p>

<h2 id="q-the-future-of-ncrl-mulang-sxsx-js-english-module">Q: The future of NCRL MuLang SX/SX-J’s English module?</h2>

<p>A: Of course that will keep receiving more and more updates in the upcoming years to come, thers’s no way for stop developing it. If you were talking about my IELTS 8.0’s expiracy date it’s fine, I will take IELTS again maybe mid or late 2026.</p>

<p>That’s my killer app, sure won’t let it outta my hand. I am really proud of myself for getting such a huge achievement with such little cost and efforts comparing to others.</p>

<h2 id="q-how-do-you-think-of-the-whole-study-in-japan-projects-end-and-final-outcomes-will-be">Q: How do you think of the whole “Study in Japan” Project’s end and final outcomes will be?</h2>

<p>A: You know, I am still under-going an negociation with my parents and that might not be that favorable due to those tensions between the two nations, but I reckon that time will have things sort out, albeit I am now pretty caucious about that new Anti-Immigrants/Foreigners trend in Japan, I understand why it happened, and who to blame, and just I can’t do anything to help resolve it, post-covid/ressecion era in history usually ends up like this, there’s a saying in Chinese quote “风水轮流转“ (Feng1Shui3Lun2Liu2Zhuan4, which means “the human history is always stuck in a loop”) unquote, the only thing I could really blame of is that I was borned in such a bad time, but no one is at fault, no one knows, it’s good timing but bad things happen and you would need to cope with it…</p>

<h2 id="q-what-about-the-whole-transitional-projet">Q: What about the whole “Transitional” projet?</h2>

<p>A: Yeah… that’s really hard to say, but as what I’ve mentioned before: I will not move on on this project too far before my financial situations change, and I have a perfectly stable job with good enought enviorment, that will be the day. And turns out that I am a Pan-sexual…</p>

<h2 id="q-whats-your-word-to-conclues-year-2025">Q: What’s your word to conclues Year 2025?</h2>

<p>A: <strong>“Experiment”</strong>, as this year I did a lot of things that I’ve never done or even dare to try before, and most of which saw pretty good outcomes, and greatly showcased what are the things that I could resolve on my own and what couldn’t. For kanji its: <strong>“験”</strong>: the kanji means “Test” or “Verify” or “Examine”, same for Chinese.</p>

<h2 id="q-what-vision-you-have-in-your-mind-for-the-upcoming-year-2026">Q: What vision you have in your mind for the upcoming Year 2026?</h2>

<p>A: Just like the question before, I would like to use an English word to summarize my visions for 2026, it’s <strong>“Change”</strong>, as I hope that I will achieve on something and <strong>“Change”</strong> the things around or on me for good. I am not Keir Starmer so no need to worry, I will change, because I really need to.</p>

<p>Anyway, see ya next post, and by that time I might just have an Apple Watch Series 11 on my wrist lol.</p>
