    <h2 id="tldr-and-some-context-as-always">TL;DR and some context as always:</h2>

<p>We all know Apple has been caught off guard in the recent AI trend, or bubble as what I like to call it. Remember dotNet bubble? that’s how it reminds me of.</p>

<p>Back to Apple, they used to be good at following trends, or start a trend even, with Siri released along side iPhone 4s in 2011, it received mixed reviews back then yes, but it also really put TTS and Voice Input/Assistant into mass market as my pov.</p>

<p>But let’s ask yourself a question:</p>

<h2 id="do-you-really-use-siri-everyday"><em>Do you really use Siri everyday?</em></h2>

<p>No, of course not. It just a niche toy to play with back in the 2010s, it’s way faster to just type your question into search engines(I use Kagi btw.) instead of saying “Hey Siri, tell me how Walter White find Gus Fring?” like an idiot everytime, just use your phone damn it! And it don’t work very well too.</p>

<p>Let’s be fair Siri is a good accessibility feature to make smart devices more easy to use by individuals suffer from disabilities, which is a nice thing to say about it.</p>

<p>But for a voice assistant, it’s too out dated, and too old for 2020s…</p>

<p>When the whole AI/LLM bubble blew out in early-2020s during covid when most were stuck at home with computers and smartphones, we all suddenly realized that computers could do more, with all those deepfake videos floating online and ChatGPT’s release. All of a sudden Siri became a thing that no only seems forgotten, but a thing of obsolescence.</p>

<h2 id="the-apple-ai-drama">The Apple AI drama</h2>

<p>Apple finally “upgraded” Siri with the intergration of Apple Intelligence in… not 2022, not 2023, in mid 2024… and with pretty much POOR reviews at best, other than the initial hype. They ended up reaching out to OpenAI for a ChatGPT intergration that connects to their server with “End-to-End Encryption”. Which is pretty much it. Some news lately indicates they’re working with Google’s Gemini on a better model.</p>

<h2 id="me-and-ai-and-siri">Me and AI and Siri</h2>

<p>Alright let’s put my priority straight here, I am don’t really like to use LLMs, let’s be honest part of that is because I don’t really know how to use them properly, I could’ve done the things I needed to do better on my own instead of asking a power hungry computer to do simple things, and I don’t trust them as well… (Oh dear the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">Hallucinations</a>…)</p>

<p>Though I still use that one feature provided by Apple AI (with my recently purchased iPhone 17, upgrading from my good old iPhone 12 mini). Like Summerize by Apple AI, when I’ve got spammed by PMs from my friends it’s a nice way to start or get a gist, but I would still went through all the messages anyway, and that’s all I ask it to do, maybe I will let them handle real-time translation later on, if needed…</p>

<p>And for Siri? I just let’em read my notifications out when I am walking through my AirPods.</p>

<p>Yeah speaking of Siri, I never enable “Hey, Siri” due to privacy concerns, it seems to be one way for some softwares to listen to what are you talking… And afraid of activating it accidentally, look here’s the thing: I speak 3~4 languages… or dialets or whatever how you count it, some words in some languages sounds like “Hey Siri” and might trigger a call…</p>

<h2 id="few-tips-for-apple-on-siri-and-apple-ai-personally">Few tips for Apple on Siri and Apple AI, personally</h2>

<p>Add third party voice please? There are so many of them, you all heard how nice Kasane Teto did in Synthesizer V AI? and many more… or VOICEROID… collab and add a fucking engine is fine… ask user to pay it, we weebs like to pay for things like this.</p>

<p>And for those stock voices… They really sounded weird today, and too mechanical, too machinery or whatever, update them please!</p>

<p>For Apple AI… better model please, and STOP BUNDLING SYSTEM LANGUAGE AND SIRI LANGUAGES: ASK JAPANESE VOICE TO READ ENGLISH TEXT IS FINE… LIKE THEY ALWAYS DID, THEY COULD REFUSE BY SAYING I CAN’T READ ANYWAY.</p>

<p>(Be fair my bad for choosing Japanese as system language but also use English and Chinese most of the time, but hey…)</p>

<p>Alright enough of rants… better get going to class…</p>
