<p>I reckon my parents finally realized how their ignorance have cause me to be like this.<br />
So they aplogized, which I did not ask for one, since I don’t really think they did all that on purpose, or more like the root of all this is due to the fact that they never had a purpose, just do it as is, without a plan, so thats okay.<br />
But still there are tons of things we don’t disagree with each other but now the gate has finally been opened, I have all the freedom to work my way out with my own effort ofc.<br />
So I reckon I could say it with confidence that Study Abroad project has been resumed, and I will spent the next semister continue working on those things that lays down the way for that.</p>
<h2 id="i-actually-had-a-great-idea-about-what-should-i-research-on">I actually had a great idea about what should I research on.</h2>
<p>I am still working my way up to get that god damn bachelor’s degree. But after I talked to (the best) doctor (in the world, yes you, if you are reading this, just wanna say thanks for actually caring me and actually remember that I made a promise almost a month back, so thanks!), which she shared some interesting things that happened around her and after listened about it(sorry I might looks like wasn’t paying attention but was actually thinking about it)</p>

<p>I reckon one of the research I could do was like: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">How social media affects China's younger generation's thoughts on LGBT+ and how it became a forbidden trend, the history about LGBT+ communities in the 21st centries China and it's potential unwanted affects for becoming a trend.</code> (The unwanted affects incl. increased stereotypes/misunderstanding from the general public, causing deeper conflics in those LGBT+ related families, and attracting those individuals that came out because it’s a trend thats “cool”).</p>

<p>I will cover both sides of the view and I reckon most of the research would be pointing fingers at the exotic internet enviorment here in China and Douyin(aka TikTok).<br />
Idk if someone see this and have thoughts about this feel free to send email for me.<br />
The hardest part of this is that how to execute the research, or how to proof this is real, where should I gather data to proof those things I know?<br />
It’s long way ahead, but at least its much more interesting, and is actually something I want to do.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-school-soon">Back to school soon.</h2>
<p>Let’s hope I could get my mental health intact this time…<br />
Ughh idk what to say now, just waiting for dinner.
See ya next post, as always.</p>
