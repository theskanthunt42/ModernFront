## Contexts

Lght, TL;DR (and contexts): This dude in my class had obivious traits of Autism, and according to my *reconnaissances*, he did ack he had autism (or according to him, Aspergers) albeit he also claims his IQ is 194, and always chat with Tencent's LLM service Yuanbao during class about his fantasy about having sex with other students in the college but in Maoist style, yes he is a huge fan of that, he acts weirdly and tends to walk out in the middle of the class at least 5 times per class, and also loves to use speech-recognition to input. "Anyway" that ain't the point, But TL;DR, he doesn't really care about how others think about him, which is a good thing tbh (I admire him on this).

## Meanwhile, how about me? And how I shape my image?

Somehow "Feminine looking" thanks to 4yrs worth of HRT at this point(not many of them knows that), a bit [menhera][enwiki-menhera], takes tons of pills at night, takes sleeping pills at night, tends to wear a hoddie, have a closet worth of Japanese school uniform (Part of J-Fasion ya know), sometimes wears them out, seems to understand English quite well, which they later bragged about, and huge hatred towards some specific English teachers("She got IELTS 8.0, I got IELTS 8.0, she said mutual respect but like to yell at us? NONE!"), which seems don't really care about it as well, recently diagnosed with ADHD plus APD, ~~with ASD thats not present on official medical records due to hospitals' policies~~, and a OTAKU, also capable of operating Unix computer off terminal.

## I see, but the point is?

Turns out that it seems like we're both *reconnaissanc/ing/* at each other, and this dude always trying to grab my attention.

Anyway, this guy do tons of annoying laughable stuff, and of course as someone who gets annoyed by it, I talks about that alot with my friends, but in fact, which I just finally accepted TODAY(okay or yesterday):
**HE KNEW I KNEW THAT I KNEW HE KNEW, FOR ALL THOSE THINGS HE DID BEING LAUGHED AT, I KNEW EXACLTY WHY, AND EXACTLY HOW HE WAS THINKING ABOUT, AND MOST OF THEM ARE THOSE THINGS THAT MY BRAIN AND TRAUMA MEMORIES STOPPING ME SO HARD TO DO WHICH MEAN I WANT TO DO AS WELL BUT ACCORDING TO MY BRAIN I SHOULDN'T**[^1]

Lght, fuck I knew it, I knew it long before today, I am so fucking laughable, I don't really hate him, just being *WEIRD* will get me [IJIME-D][jawiki-ijime] so I pretend to separate from it, I am just laughing in front of the mirror, thats it.

I am so sleepy now, I will just end here and skip writing diary tonight.
