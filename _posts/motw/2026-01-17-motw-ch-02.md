At least I remember this week.  
Been messing with that exam week shit and watching Pluribus(Frankly it's quite good! Go watch on Apple TV now!)  
So here we go...

It's been a busy(and sleepy) week so I don't have that many time circle through my Apple Music playlist.  
I just repeat all those tracks I've recommended in the last *"issuse"* of MotW, but there are some stand-outs still.

Wait what had I done this week, oh I've watched Pluribus on Apple TV, great show by the amazing Vince Gilligan crew again!

Okay not much to say really... just stay tune for more... I've been asleep most of the time since went back home.
