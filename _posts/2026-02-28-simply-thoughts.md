## I hate going to school...
I am typing this on my beloved 23.8 inch 4K HiDPI display with my Mac mini which means... I am sitting in the dorm right now.  
The worst things is not that I have to wake up at 7am every morning in the next 4mos which I am actually okay aboutbut the fact that someone I hate still teaches me, like wtf, I really hope I could appeal to the academic affairs office and I mean it, being a person that use English as a second language that are able to watch UK House of Commons PMQs without any subtitles or BSL(idk how to read BSL tbh), LIVE, ON YOUTUBE, without a problem and know exactly how those politicians attacking each other, and know the agenda of the day, I still need to go through another course on English listening and speaking? You joking? I got higher scores than that bastrd in both IELTS Listening Section and Speaking Section, and we're the same on average. I went abroad on my own speaking only English and got no prob with talking to others online using English as well.  
Let HER to teach me? Oh what a disgrace, to me.  
I won't forgot all her shitty talks behind my back about me.  
*just watch me.* - famous Canadian PM quote.

## My mental health.
Improving... is the best word to describe it.  
Like taking Lithiums makes me feel really dizzy, and sleepy, but at least it did get things under control, and taking Methylphenidate as prescribed does combat some of those side effects out, but as a general side effect, you ended up becoming really tired at the end of the day, sure is a pro since I got sleeping disorders but still, everyday you feels like a empty hull wandering around just to get things done.  
Just hope those shit won't hit again, I hope... I prob need to ask for some breaks from time to time, I am sorry homeroom teacher.  

## Should start my works on Japanese...
At least grab a JLPT N4 as a proof of concept.  

## Just Cope with it.
I hope so.  
And maybe building that weather satellite earth station is a good idea to work on.  
Just I need to pull an CAT-5e from roof to home, kinda crazy.

## Wraps up

*Da Sind Wir Aber Immer Noch*

(I know but as a "I LOVE MYSELF" view point, and it's a good song why not, if you don't look at that populist lyrics its fine.)
