## Mumbles...

Thinking about buying a *SECOND* Intel Arc B580.

For no reason, just being a Arc fan-*human*-ish-young-pal.

I was thinking about buying a Arc B380 if it exist, with at least 6GB of VRAM ofc, but that's impossible with the current DRAM market that has been exploited by those **AI-bubble-blowing rich capitalists who holds a tons of AI-related corpos' stock**, yes I am talking about Nvidia and Micron, oh fuck you Micron I loved you so much, Crucial used to be my only NAND Flash/DRAM choice, till I swapped to KIOXIA for NANDs.

And btw, 

> *Fuck you Nvidia.*

Anyway, back on topic about Arc B580s and B380s in fantasies...

I was thinking about buying one for gaming purposes, light gaming you know, RPGs, Racers, VNs, whatever, Minecrafts... and since I am not a huge fan of the *Ray-Tracing* effects(Like I can see the difference, but thats fine for someone who grew up with Nintendo Wii), I just want something a bit more powerful than my AMD/**ATI** [RX6400][navi-24-xl-tpu] (You shouldn't buy it, I will talk about it later on this blog, stay tune).

Speaking of which, that was me fell under Mandela-effect thinking [Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 RELOAD][smt-p3r-link] was release on OG Nintendo Switch as well, and I have a Switch lite so why not buy it and revisit that, but unfortunately the only thing on that OG Switch was [SMT:P3P][smt-p3p-wiki]... which sucks, but let's get'em bonus: it's not bad for a PSP disc title that fit in that lil disk... but why build newer ports on top of that... I played [SMT:P3F][smt-p3f-wiki] on PS2 via disc btw...

And what about that [flashy new Atlus game][mtp-rf-wiki] on Switch...? Nope, not even on Nintendo hardwares yet, even if it might just be on Switch 2 so... pretty hopeless, PS5 Handheld or maybe even Steam Deck 2...ish stuff might be the options later so gotta just wait, I just better be stick with PC versions for now I reckon...

It's late at night, 0120AM in fact, for editing that fucking [fake thesis][fk-schl]... I outght just hop into bed and go grab some sleep...

See ya next post.
