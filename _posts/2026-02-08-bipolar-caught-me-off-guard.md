# Howdy, somehow back.
I am kinda back after at least 4 days worth of extreme depressive period, with every single day more suffering than the days before it.  
You woked up late everyday even after full 12hrs of sleep that even me being someone who loves to sleep(i guess) starts to dislike this fact, when you're asleep, all the nightmares are chasing you on your ass, 12hrs(maybe 8hr dreaming) worth of shit show chasing you on your back sure wasn't something you would love to do.  
But you simply can't get rid of it, your body simply drag you back down continue sleeping for no reason, I guess it's not just about pills this time.  
My mom caught the worst timing in all of this yet, she tried to see how I am doing right in the middle of a transitional period(which my brain is on it's way to tranform itself into depressive mode from a mixed/manic mode which I did a lot a thing for fun.)  
I simply just shit out a tons of fact that I simply didn't enjoy all those playing card moment she gave me and all those single option choices she gave me and the fact that she never really stood up for me when I am the most in need.  
I mean, I did put all that down a few years ago and I am simply telling her the fact, and which somehow broke her and I am sorry about that but I don't have time for that as well since I am starting to tearing all apart as well.  
And oh btw, the whole thing about "How happy you was in the Manic Period, how suffer you will be in the Depressive Period" is true I guess, I am now taking Lithiums and stuff like that regulary according to the prescription and after I told my doc about this she said we really needs to get that manic heat a bit down other wise I might get myself killed if Depressive hit.  Which I almost did yesterday.  I've already chosen a method for that.
# So... Where was I again, before all this
I was messing with my GK-2A recepetion setup, and my receipt printer right before all those hit, and Idk maybe some other shit I forgot about.  
I did manage to set it up, but some how the long distance won't do the trick, I guess I will move it back to the old house I reckon, after Lunar New Year I think.  
And my receipt printer stuff is running fine for now, printing news every 6 hrs for me to read. Yes I actually read news.  
# Next?
Idk I forgot/don't want to take Concerta today so I am a bit hairy now and needs to sort things out, maybe I will just have some simple stuff sort out like replacing the screen protectors and dealing with miniDLAN/UPnP media server and watch some more YouTube and more Mangas for sure.  
And my somehow broken uConsole case's 3D-printed replacement is going to arrive sometime tonight, and I guess that right-wing populist will win that snap election, ofc I hope she won't but according to the numbers its... most likly the case.
