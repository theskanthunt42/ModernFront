## uConsole NVMe Upgrade Kit
So I bought [this](https://hackergadgets.com/products/uconsole-upgrade-kit?variant=47038702682286).  
`uConsole Upgrade Kit - Adding NVMe SSD/RJ45 Ethernet/ USB 3.0/AC1200 WiFi`  
As the title suggest, now I got NVMe SSD and RJ45 GbE and two USB3.0 outta my Raspberry Pi CM5 in that uConsole.  
I didn't expected it to work that well but it did, and because of the fact that I currently don't have any BIGG NVMe SSD around so I put in a 16GB Optane M10 for swap that I probably never going to use instead.  
1-lane PCIe 2.0 sometimes could be up to 3.0? works at nice snappy speed w/o a prob.  
The RJ-45 was pulled directly from RP1 southbridge onboard CM5 which is connected to the SoC via 4-lanes of PCIe 2.0, ran great with full-speed GbE(I tested that already).  
USB3.0? Haven't tried that yet but useful later.  
At least thats 1 more USB-A onboard the uConsole. And plus a USB-C 3.0 idk could I charge it on that or not yet prob not.  
And funny enough it somehow blew my M4 MacBook Air outta the water on some tasks except actual computing that requires a bigger screen and better keyboard and better performance and better battery, uC is enough for my RTL-SDR anyway.(Oh my somehow failed yet on the way Satellite recv project)  
Tbh with you I could hardly fill that 4GB RAM on my CM5, I can't imagine me filling up that M10 in swap, my whole system currently took up 12GB on my SDCard so... But swap on a drive like M10 does somehow extend the life of that SDCard I reckon.  
Anyway just enjoying fun on my uConsole.

## I am out of things to read...
Right before the Lunar New Year I am already bored. 20hrs after recovered from that depressive period and I rushed to do something else new, I am already out of things to do, or even to read, I was wandering through yamibo for stuff to read while waiting all my favourite novels to update, which is bored, I didn't sleep well last night, and after waking up at 8am I decided fine I gotta wake up and live a day, turns out to be a pretty boring day, my grandparents and my aunt are making living noises that almost driven me crazy, but that ain't their fault, just ah fine some part of that was their fault for being too loud, and me being to easy to get disrupt and distract, but whatever.  

And remember that I said I gotta watch Haibane Renmei last time? Well after watching two EPs straight during midnight I reckon I don't have the guts to continue watching it like many other anime I've downloaded, might take a while for me to re-enter this, just because like kinda not at the right mood to watch that? I mean not this time, later time(like how I dealt with that anime talks about supposed Introvert Pink Hair Japanese Otaku Girl with her five/six wives anime, someone loves to compares between me and her and I was like bro you gotta be kidding I got my gender wrong for that, and if I was her, I would go and have 10 waifus instead.)  

But yep. nothing to do now, maybe rewatch old anime(old means I first watched it a long time ago), notable examples incl. Lucky Star, Serial Experiments Lain, Haruhi Suzumiya 2006, etc...  
No HyouKa, since that is a piece of shit that talks about some idiotic high schoolers circlejerking on their circlejerking skills(e.g. how good they "Investigate stuff").  
And no Liz and the Blue Bird since after I got the BD on hand I've watched it for like a billion times already, but being a Yuri Specialist *My soul* is always ready for this kind of top tier Yuri/Lesbian contents.  

## About that Q&A I had today
I really don't like someone ask me this question:  
Q: *When can you stop taking those pills?*  
A: Only when doctor say yes.

Anyway, I am a bit tired after dinner, good night, and I should take my pills btw.  

Good night, and see you next post.
