## Hi Nvidia!

# **Fuck you.**

## So Intel held a keynote in CES, with not many things to look at.

I mean, I am not totally suprised by this...? But I don't really see much of a exciting news comming out, at least they did have *Core Ultra Series 3* (gosh please fix your naming Intel).

And they're only putting Arc B390 onto a SoC, okay...? Ever since Nvidia got involed into this stuff I know they wouldn't do anything that are consumer friendly like having a lower end dGPU please? Won't Nvidia might not let them.

Sure, there might be a possibility that Arc B390 will come out as a dGPU later or as a Workstation GPU or sth like that but I am just really disappointed by all this.

And btw, wheres the Arc B770 honey?

Might just stuck with all these B580 paradise, oh speaking of which I've been running Gemma 3 12b locally recently, just for fun. Hey it's fast, but do remember to enable flash attention or the performance really hurt.

And I am not all that into PC building lately since I mainly use my Mac... x86-64 are just for Gaming and High-Performance works and LLMs and LLM translators and some video transcoding and some fun experiments.

Albeit I might rebuild my home "server", oust the PVE on a ThinkCentre, put a Raspberry Pi CM5 Lite on a extenstion board and put it into a case and call it a day, at least I could put Intel Optane M10 onto it... It's for voice chatting server only so anyway. Power efficiency is important and I need something that would run on a cheaper UPS.

Alright... see ya, it's so fucking cold these day.
