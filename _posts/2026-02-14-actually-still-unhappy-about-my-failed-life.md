## The pals around me or at least the ones that are still willing to talks to me be like:
- Mostly on their way of grabbing Master degree in some very well known colleges, you know the drill.
- Study things that they choose or they love about.
- Really good at things they do.
- 100% support from families.
- There parents somehow got a plan long ago but well executed
- Idk why they are still williing to talk to me, I am such a loser anyway.

Comparing with ...
## Me living a loser life:
- Didn't went to an actual high school. Went to Vocational High instead.
- Struggled in a Vacational College(unless you win big, other wise losers place), and somehow able to struggled out to a better one that could botain BA.
- Struggle to even obtain an Bachelor's degree after all these years.
- Really bad at things that I needs to do.
- 20% Family support only in cash and only when they think you are doing what they think you should, and they tbh don't know what should do either. and otherwise (most of the time) 0%.
- Parents got a plan, but they don't know should they with it mid-road or got distracted by sth else or even "you shouldn't let your kids do that" plus they revealed that I am sort of under the rainbow flag and ceased any plans that could get me to a better place.
- Rotten at home.

## TLDR.
I LOSE. ALREADY, AND I KNEW IT LONG AGO.
I hope things will get slightly better... I know that might not look good but at this point it looks like my only way out.
