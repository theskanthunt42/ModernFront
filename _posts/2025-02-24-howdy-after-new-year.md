## The Sun is back on the horizon, again, and I finally saw a chance to live in the way I want, again.
I reckon my parents finally realized how their ignorance have cause me to be like this.  
So they aplogized, which I did not ask for one, since I don't really think they did all that on purpose, or more like the root of all this is due to the fact that they never had a purpose, just do it as is, without a plan, so thats okay.  
But still there are tons of things we don't disagree with each other but now the gate has finally been opened, I have all the freedom to work my way out with my own effort ofc.  
So I reckon I could say it with confidence that Study Abroad project has been resumed, and I will spent the next semister continue working on those things that lays down the way for that.  
## I actually had a great idea about what should I research on.
I am still working my way up to get that god damn bachelor's degree. But after I talked to (the best) doctor (in the world, yes you, if you are reading this, just wanna say thanks for actually caring me and actually remember that I made a promise almost a month back, so thanks!), which she shared some interesting things that happened around her and after listened about it(sorry I might looks like wasn't paying attention but was actually thinking about it)  

I reckon one of the research I could do was like: `How social media affects China's younger generation's thoughts on LGBT+ and how it became a forbidden trend, the history about LGBT+ communities in the 21st centries China and it's potential unwanted affects for becoming a trend.` (The unwanted affects incl. increased stereotypes/misunderstanding from the general public, causing deeper conflics in those LGBT+ related families, and attracting those individuals that came out because it's a trend thats "cool").  

I will cover both sides of the view and I reckon most of the research would be pointing fingers at the exotic internet enviorment here in China and Douyin(aka TikTok).  
Idk if someone see this and have thoughts about this feel free to send email for me.  
The hardest part of this is that how to execute the research, or how to proof this is real, where should I gather data to proof those things I know?  
It's long way ahead, but at least its much more interesting, and is actually something I want to do.  

## Back to school soon.
Let's hope I could get my mental health intact this time...  
Ughh idk what to say now, just waiting for dinner.
See ya next post, as always.
